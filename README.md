# Interesting Projects

Hi! My name is KeyoMeyo. This is my repository of cool shit that I'm working on at any given point.

Anytime anyone wants to suggest changes, **make your own branch** and have at it. Don't alter the master branch direct (that is mine own right).

Any suggestions for new shit? Hit me up and tell me what you think is a dank idea.

Some projects may come in at various times from my school work and from my much more personal repository *hello world*.
